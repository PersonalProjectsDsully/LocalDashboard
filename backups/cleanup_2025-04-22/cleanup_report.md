# Code Cleanup Report - 2025-04-22

## Summary
This cleanup process identified and removed several unused files and functions from the LocalDashboard project.

## Files Removed
1. `tauri/src/pages/Chat/ChatTest.tsx` - Unused test component
2. `tauri/src/pages/Chat/ChatNew.tsx` - Unused alternative Chat implementation
3. `tauri/src/pages/Chat/ChatDebug.tsx` - Unused debug layout for Chat
4. `tauri/src/pages/Chat/TestChange.txt` - Unused test file
5. `sync_chat.ps1` - Unused PowerShell script for chat synchronization
6. `ask_about_projects.ps1` - Utility script that was not being used in the main codebase
7. `ask_dashboard.ps1` - Utility script that was not being used in the main codebase

## Code Modifications
1. In `tauri/src/App.tsx`:
   - Removed unused import `useLocation` from react-router-dom
   - Removed unused variable `location` in the App component

2. In `tauri/src/components/CommandPalette.tsx`:
   - Removed unused imports `ActionImpl`, `ActionId`, and `createAction` from kbar

3. In `workspace_snap_agent.py`:
   - Removed commented out code for admin privilege checks that was not being used

## Files Kept (Despite Initial Suspicion)
1. `components/migrateLegacyData.ts` - This is actively used in Alarms.tsx for data migration
2. `auto_sync_focus_logs.bat` - Used for focus log synchronization
3. `sync_focus_logs.bat` - Same purpose but for one-time sync instead of continuous

## Backup Process
All removed files were backed up to the `backups/cleanup_2025-04-22/` directory before deletion.

## Benefits
1. Improved code maintainability by reducing the number of files to track
2. Reduced potential confusion from having multiple implementations of the same component
3. Cleaner imports in the main App component
4. Better organized codebase with less dead code
