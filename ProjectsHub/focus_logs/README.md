# Focus Logs Directory

This directory previously contained copies of focus logs from the FocusTimer application.

As of the April 2025 update, the LocalDashboard application now reads focus logs directly from:
`C:\Users\admin\Desktop\FocusTimer\focus_logs`

This directory is kept for backward compatibility but no longer contains synchronized log files.
