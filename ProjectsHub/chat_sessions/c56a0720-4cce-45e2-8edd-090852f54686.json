Task-5 (\"User testing\") is also in-progress but assigned to Jane Smith. Task-6 (\"Launch website\") is in-progress and assigned to John Doe.\n  \n- For Project-B (Mobile App Development), there are no tasks that seem to be assigned to you or in progress.\n\nSo, based on this limited information, it appears that you might be working on Project-A: Website Redesign, possibly as Jane Smith, although this is not explicitly stated.",
