# Focus Logs Direct Reading Update

## Summary
The LocalDashboard application has been modified to read focus logs directly from their source directory instead of requiring synchronization through batch files. This change simplifies the architecture and eliminates the need for manual or automated copying of focus log files.

## Changes Made

1. **Backend API Modifications**:
   - Updated the API to read focus logs directly from `C:\Users\admin\Desktop\FocusTimer\focus_logs`
   - Added a dedicated endpoint to serve focus log files (screenshots, etc.) directly from source
   - Removed the fallback code that looked for focus logs in multiple locations

2. **Removed Batch Files**:
   - `sync_focus_logs.bat` - One-time synchronization script
   - `auto_sync_focus_logs.bat` - Continuous synchronization script (60-second intervals)
   - These files have been moved to `backups/focus_log_batch_backups/` for reference

3. **Updated Development Script**:
   - Modified `start_dev.bat` to remove references to focus log synchronization
   - Updated output messages to reflect the new architecture

4. **Cleaned Up Duplicate Data**:
   - Created a README.md in the `ProjectsHub/focus_logs/` directory explaining the change
   - This directory is maintained for backward compatibility but no longer contains synchronized files

## Benefits
- Simpler architecture with fewer moving parts
- Eliminates the need to remember to run synchronization scripts
- Reduces disk usage by not duplicating large log files
- Ensures dashboard always displays the most up-to-date focus data

## How to Test
1. Start the LocalDashboard application using `start_dev.bat`
2. Navigate to the Dashboard tab
3. The focus data should load directly from the FocusTimer directory without any synchronization
4. Screenshots and other focus log files should be displayed correctly

## Reverting (if needed)
If issues arise with this approach, the original batch files can be restored from the `backups/focus_log_batch_backups/` directory.
